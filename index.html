      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I spent more than a decade (2003–2015) building large-scale distributed systems across
        enterprise environments—databases, multi-terabyte migrations, workforce management
        platforms, and hybrid cloud infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        After stepping away to raise a family and run a business, I returned with a clearer sense
        of what I wanted to build: systems that matter at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years ago, I reskilled into AI infrastructure. I returned to my core strengths—designing
        architectures, debugging with precision, and shipping reliable, production-ready systems.
        My work now spans GPU inference, distributed microservices, data pipelines, and open-source
        contributions to projects like vLLM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think in systems and visuals. I learn top-down. I debug methodically. I ship real work.

    <!-- WHAT I DO / FOCUS SECTION -->
    <section id="what-i-do" class="section">
      <h2>What I Do</h2>

      <h3>Backend Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        I design and build microservices, distributed systems, and event-driven architectures with
        a focus on reliability, observability, and clean, testable code.
      </p>

      <h3>AI Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        I work across GPU inference, LLM runtimes, and high-performance data flows—optimizing for
        latency, throughput, and cost.
      </p>

      <h3>Distributed Systems &amp; Data Pipelines</h3>
      <p>
        I build and operate systems that move data across Kafka, Redis, Ray, and cloud-native
        environments with correctness and resilience.
      </p>

      <h3>Debugging &amp; Reliability</h3>
      <p>
        I’m at my best when diagnosing complex failures across layers—networking, concurrency,
        scheduling, storage, and runtime behavior.
      </p>

    <!-- INTERESTS SECTION -->
    <section id="interests" class="section">
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I study AI and quantum research, follow Google’s engineering blogs, and write about AI
        infrastructure on StackBytes. I travel for fun and to spend meaningful time with my family.
      </p>
